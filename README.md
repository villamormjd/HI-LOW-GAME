# Hi-Low Game

This is my Hi-Low Game to practice my OOP and python programming skills.

## How it works:
* A random number will generate.
* Player will choose and guess whether the number is (HIGH) higher than 5 or (LOW) less than or equal to 5.
* A start money here is 100.
* When a player's guess is right the current money will increase by 10.
* When a player's guess is wrong the curretn money will decrease by 10.
* Player has option if he wants to continue to play the game or exit the game.
